## This code is meant to render a code that test your knowledge on the Pittsburgh Steelers NFL football team. It gives you 60 seconds to answer all five questions, and whatever time you have left over is your final score. It then ask you to enter your initials to keep in local storage for the high score page.

## Steps I took to create project

# 1. Create an array of questions that render when "start quiz" button is clicked.
# 2. Then created a timer to subtract 10 seconds everytime a question is answered incorrectly.
# 3. After the questions and timer were created, I attempted to render a high scores page.

## Issues

# Could not get local storage to render the high scores

# Will continue to work on the issues I had and try to add some icebox features.
